# Binary Palindrome Checker

This Python script checks if a decimal number is a palindrome when converted to its binary representation.
This was created as a portfolio project for my data science bootcamp.

## Features

* **Decimal to binary conversion:**  Converts an input decimal number to its binary equivalent.
* **Palindrome detection:** Determines if the binary representation of the input number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
* **User-friendly input:** Takes a decimal number as input from the user.
* **Error handling:** Catches invalid inputs (non-numeric values).
* **Continuous checking:** Allows the user to check multiple numbers in a row.

## Installation

This script has no external dependencies. You only need a standard Python installation.

## Usage

1. **Download or copy the Python script (`main.py`).
2. **Execute the script from your terminal:**
   ```bash
   python binary_palindrome.py
